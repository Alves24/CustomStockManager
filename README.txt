# Custom stock manager for a waterproof factory


## About this project

This WinForms app was thinked to operated it with 2 main functions: 
- Add paint productions
- Inform order sales

With only these 2 things you can pretty much control and manage the raw and main products of the factory.
It was thinked to be flexible to the changes in the factory, so you can add new productss, new raw materials, new recipes, etc.
But is not flexible at all to implement it in another diferent factory. 
It has a custom business logic that is not configurable.

Horrible code btw.. i was learning c# and object's meanwhile i made this project... 
But i think that i did a really good job for the graphic interface (Windows Forms).

## More details
The program uses SQLite for database and some HTLM and CSS for create some reports
